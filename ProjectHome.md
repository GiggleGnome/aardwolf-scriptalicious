# Aardwolf Mush Client Plugins and VI support #

## Search and Destroy Plugin STANDALONE (Version 2.8) ##
Combines the power of:
  * auto-hunt,
  * hunt-trick (now with hot-swappable targets),
  * quick-where (linking where to your mush mapper),
  * awesome-kill (command that attacks your last entered mob) and
  * quick-scan (scanning for the last mob you hunted for)
to make an integrated plugin that will make quests and campaigns a lot more streamlined.

## Search and Destroy Triple Pack v2.8 ##

If you are confident creating custom exits (cexits) in mush, then you might want to install the Search and Destroy Triple pack, bundled with Mapper Extender which will:
  * run you to the first room in any area the fastest possible way
  * greatly assist you in campaign and quests
  * a room iterator so you can search for rooms of a matching name and move through them by typing "next"
  * includes a GUI/Miniwindow for listing campaigns, and providing buttons for common S&D commands

## Super-clean Spellup Plugin (Version 2.9) ##
A simple spellup plugin that will auto renew spells and skills you have practiced more than 1% that expires.
  * Fully VI compatible
  * A single, self-contained plugin
  * Will not cast in combat, afk, sleeping, etc, but instead will queue up expired spells to cast when player is ready
  * Has an exclusion list for fine-tuning spellups
  * Support for clan skill renewal (Type "slist" to find your clan sn!!)
  * Does not renew recoveries as the timing on these items is sensitive
